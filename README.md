# ✅ Backend & Database (Critical Missing Components)

## 🔐 Authentication System
- [ ] No actual user authentication (login/register just show toasts)
- [ ] No user session management
- [ ] No password reset functionality
- [ ] No user role-based access control

## 🗃️ Database Schema & Tables
- [ ] Users table (with roles: donor, ngo, delivery)
- [ ] Donations table (items, quantities, pickup locations, status)
- [ ] NGOs table (organization details, verification status)
- [ ] Delivery personnel table (vehicle info, availability)
- [ ] Pickup/delivery assignments table
- [ ] Transaction/history logs
- [ ] Impact tracking data

## 📡 API Endpoints
- [ ] User registration/login/logout
- [ ] Donation CRUD operations
- [ ] NGO management (browse donations, claim pickups)
- [ ] Delivery assignment and tracking
- [ ] Real-time status updates
- [ ] Location/mapping services
- [ ] Analytics and reporting data

## 🎯 Core Functionality (Currently Mock Data)

### 📦 Donation Management
- [ ] Actual donation creation and storage
- [ ] Image upload for donation items
- [ ] Location/address validation and storage
- [ ] Pickup scheduling system

### 🔄 Matching System

- [ ] Distance-based availability
- [ ] NGO capacity and requirements matching

## ⚡ Real-time Features
- [ ] Live tracking of deliveries
- [ ] Push notifications for status updates
- [ ] Real-time messaging between parties

## 🔌 External Integrations Needed

### 🗺️ Maps & Location Services
- [ ] Google Maps/Mapbox integration for:
  - [ ] Address validation
  - [ ] Route optimization
  - [ ] Real-time tracking

- [ ] Environment variables management
- [ ] SSL certificates
- [ ] Domain setup

## 📊 Advanced Features

### 📈 Analytics & Reporting
- [ ] Impact tracking dashboard
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Financial reporting (if monetary donations)

### ✅ Verification System
- [ ] NGO verification process

- [ ] Mobile-specific optimizations

## 🧭 Recommended Next Steps
- [ ] Set up Supabase - This would handle authentication, database, file storage, and real-time features
- [ ] Implement authentication - Start with user registration/login
- [ ] Create database schema - Design and create all necessary tables
- [ ] Build core API endpoints - Starting with donation management
- [ ] Integrate maps service - For location features
- [ ] Add real-time features - Status updates and tracking

## Database Setup

Run the SQL file in `supabase/migrations/0001_create_profiles.sql` on your
Supabase project to create the `profiles` table used for storing user details
and roles.
